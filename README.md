A game made for [GBJAM 8](https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-8). Try to deliver all of your crates to the appointed destination before your oxygen tank runs out! As you fulfill your orders and progress through the game, you will need to deliver more crates, maneuver through more densely packed fishes, and find additional crates lost on the ocean floor!

## Controls
- **W, A, S, D** to orient your ship
- **J** to thrust
- **K** to throw crates
- **Esc** to go back to the main menu

All of the crates must be detached from your ship into the destination site in order to proceed to the next level.

### Tips

You don't need to deliver all of the crates at once!
Remember that your arrow indicators point to where you need to go.
You can use your submarine as a barrier to protect the crates from the fishes! Tilt up for maximum surface area.
If you are low on oxygen, you can go back to the base or destination building to replenish it before attempting to retrieve the crates again.

## Cut features

Various kinds of crates
Upgrade mechanic depending on the types of crates delivered
Randomly generated map (inside of a ship) instead of open world
Envisioned to be more of a dungeon-crawler than a dexterity game initially, but settled on the dexterity mechanics due to time constraints
